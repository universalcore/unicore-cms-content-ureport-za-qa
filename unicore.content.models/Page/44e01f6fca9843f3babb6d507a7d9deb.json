  "content": "Defilement is defined as the act of having sex with a girl under 18. Often times, defilement involves relatives, married men or professional people in the community. It can lead to infertility, trauma, contraction of HIV/Aids, terminal illness or even death. Defilement cases at times become difficult to prove because the victims lack birth certificates. At times, the victim's parents too connive with the perpetrators by accepting bribes.\r\n\r\nThe Penal Code Act (Amendment) 2007 states that any person who attempts to perform a sexual act with another person who is below the age of eighteen years commits an offence and is on conviction, liable to imprisonment not exceeding eighteen years. Any person who performs a sexual act with another person who is below the age of eighteen years in any of the circumstances specified in subsection (4) commits a felony called aggravated defilement and is, on conviction by the High Court, liable to suffer death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Ur Story][1]\r\n\r\n[U-Act][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/590f8f39c74e4e44a07c6a31e941b976/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/8135c17d1c19466d826d66f0742d79bf/",
