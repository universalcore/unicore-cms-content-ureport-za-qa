  "content": "In Uganda, defilement is defined as the act of having sex with a girl under 18. Often times, defilement involves relatives, married men or professional people in the community. It can lead to infertility, trauma, contraction of HIV/Aids, terminal illness or even death. Children become victims of defilement due to lack of birth certificates. At times, the victim's parents too connive with the perpetrators by accepting bribes.",
